# **Hey, I'm Ailakks! :D**

### **Introduction**
I'm a passionate 19-year-old developer who **loves building cool stuff** with **Java** and **JavaScript**. I'm particularly skilled in **designing websites** and creating **robust APIs** using the latest technologies like **React** and **NestJS**.

Apart from personal projects, I work on various **personal projects**, some of which are related to **artificial intelligence**. I love exploring **new technologies** and experimenting with them to create **unique solutions** that **solve real-world problems**.

I have also worked for several **large Minecraft servers and content creators**, where I created **games and events** that were enjoyed by **thousands of people**.
